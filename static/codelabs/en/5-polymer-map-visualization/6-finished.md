### Finished!

You've built the beginnings of an app to visualize massive amounts of geographic
data. `<point-overlay>` abstracts some of the details away from you, but, just
as we reached into the `<google-map>` to get the raw `Map` object, you can reach
into `<point-overlay>` and get the underlying `PointMap` object and even access
the `<canvas>` element itself. Everything can be modified, from default colors,
even to the shader code itself.

Now that you have a working start, change anything and everything to see what
else you can make.
